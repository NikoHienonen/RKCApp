## General info
The Volleyball App of RKC-Volley. They use this to organize tournaments and referee their home games.
The project has two parts, the native app and an api backend. From the api, the client can manage
tournaments through a ReactJS interface. The code is sloppy at times, this was from the deadline
requirements, in the future I might review the code a bit and clean it up.
